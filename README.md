# Digital Reality | Aniruddha Adak Portfolio 2026 🚀

> **"Where Engineering Meets Editorial Design."**
> A high-performance, immersive portfolio application built with **Next.js 15**, **GSAP**, and **Tailwind CSS**. Designed to push the boundaries of web interactivity with physics-based motion, 3D transformations, and a "Digital Reality" aesthetic.

## ✨ Core Philosophy

This portfolio is not just a collection of links; it's a **Digital Reality**. The concept merges the precision of engineering with the elegance of high-end editorial design.
- **Visual Language**: Clean topography, subtle grid systems, and atmospheric lighting.
- **Motion Design**: Fluid, physics-based interactions that feel alive, not just animated.
- **Typography**: Brutalist headers paired with Swiss-style body text for maximum readability and impact.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. **The Core Engine (Skills System)**
An interactive visualization of technical proficiency.
- **List-Detail Architecture**: Clicking a skill instantly updates a holographic detail card.
- **Brand Identity**: Dynamic color injection (e.g., React Blue, Node Green) for unique glowing effects.
- **Tech Soup Parallax**: A subtle, floating background of technology icons that responds to scroll.

### 2. **Selected Works (Project Gallery)**
A showcase of flagship projects with cinematic presentation.
- **3D Card Flips**: Interactive cards that reveal details with a satisfying 3D flip.
- **Category Filtering**: Seamless `FLIP` transitions when filtering projects by type.
- **Atmospheric Lighting**: Gradient overlays that react to mouse movement.

### 3. **Experience Timeline**
A journey through professional growth.
- **Visual Continuity**: A continuous line that draws itself as you scroll, connecting different eras of experience.
- **Holographic Cards**: Glassmorphism effects that highlight roles without cluttering the screen.

### 4. **The Lab (Playground)**
A space for experimental UI/UX concepts.
- **Physics Draggables**: Elements that can be thrown, dragged, and interacted with using proper inertia.
- **Generative Art**: Dynamic visual experiments powered by code.

### 5. **Magnetic Contact Interface**
- **Gravity UI**: Buttons that magnetically pull towards your cursor.
- **Particle Systems**: Subtle background effects that add life to the form.
